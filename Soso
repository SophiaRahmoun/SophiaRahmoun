### Hi there 👋

I'm a third-year Multimedia & Creative Technologies student based in Brussels, passionate about **design, development, & creative tech**.

I enjoy working on web & mobile projects where design and functionality go hand in hand !
Over the past few years, I’ve worked on real client projects, helped organize cultural events, and even balanced freelance work with customer-facing jobs. 

> ‼️ I’m currently looking for an internship in **creative tech** (design, dev, or both! ) in **Kuala Lumpur** between **January and April 2026**.>
